## This is my report!

I like writing reports 

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(all)
source(analysis)

```

```{r exampple, include = FALSE}
numbers <- runif(1:100)
hist(numbers)

numbers_mean <- mean(numbers) #get mean

img_url <- "![puppies](link to a puppy picture - img url)"


```

The mean of the numbers happens to be `r numbers_mean`.



```{r other-chunk}
print(numbers)
```






```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
